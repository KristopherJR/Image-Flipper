# Image-Flipper
This is a basic image manipulation that serves as the software artefact for my COMP3404-Applied Software Engineering Assignment 1. The software comprises a 3-tier structure: Client, Server and Controller. The program will allow the user to load in an image from disc, store them in the Servers memory and make basic manipulations such as rotation and flipping. The user can save any changes they make to the original image, or save a copy if they wish.
